					<p>Hello!</p>
                    <p>
                    I am an assistant professor of Linguistics (and by courtesy Computer Science) at the University of British Columbia. Before that, I was a <a href=https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/>Kempner Fellow</a> at Harvard, and before that I did my PhD in Computer Science at the Stanford NLP group, advised by Dan Jurafsky. </p>
                   <p>
                   <b>I am looking to recruit students</b>. If you are applying for a PhD in NLP or computational linguistics, apply to UBC linguistics or CS and mention that you'd like to work with me!
                   </p>
                   <p> 
                   I work on understanding and defining the capabilities of large language models in relation to the human language system. 
                   </p>
                   <p>
                   I am especially interested in pursuing an interdisciplinary research program, combining computational empirical machine learning methods with theories of human language. My principal interests include:  how language models learn and use <b>generalizable grammatical abstractions</b>, the <b>interaction between structure and meaning</b> representations in high-dimensional vector spaces, and using <b>multilingual settings</b> to test the limits of abstraction in language models.
                   </p>

                    <!--- <p>I am funded by an <a href=https://www.nsfgrfp.org/>NSF GRFP fellowship</a>, and a <a href=https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf/details>Stanford Graduate Fellowship. </a></p> --->

                <h2 id="joininglab">Joining the Lab</h2>
                <p>I'm looking for PhD and masters students to join the lab! You can work with me if you apply through Linguistics or through CS. The <a href="https://nlp.cs.ubc.ca/people" target="_blank">UBC NLP Group</a> is growing, with many new faculty members and exciting research directions, and we'd love to have you join! I am generally looking for students who want to deeply understand how lanugage models work, who have a scientific interest in human language, and who have some experience working with machine learning. We are a very open-minded linguistics department, and a fun, interdisciplinary NLP group with research to suit many tastes.</p>
                
                <p>You can apply for a PhD in <a href="https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-linguistics", target="_blank">Linguistics</a> or <a href="https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-computer-science" target="_blank">CS</a>, or for a masters (<a href="https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/master-of-arts-linguistics" target="_blank">ling masters</a>, <a href="https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/master-of-science-computer-science" target="_blank">CS masters</a>). You can also apply to both departments. There are different experience requirements for the programs, and also slightly more funding sources available to support students through Linguistics, I'm happy to advise on which one is a better fit.</p>

                <p>I tend to not reply to open-ended general emails about joining the group, sorry. If you have a specific question about joining the lab or working together, please do feel free to email me! (It's great if you can include a short sentence about why you think our research interests match, but don't worry too much about crafting this)</p>
